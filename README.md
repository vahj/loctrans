# loctrans
simple local translations with dict

this is a very simple and dirty coded local translation tool, but it works, is easy to use and might be helpful

1. on linux copy all these files into ~/bin
2. make them executable by chmod u+x [filenames]
3. install dict sudo `apt-get install dict dictd dict-de-en` (or other language packages)
4. bind keyboard shortcuts to trans-entry and trans-marked
5. trans-entry: just use your keyboard shortcut, enter your word and voila
6. trans-marked: first mark a word, anywhere on your system, then just use the keyboard shortcut for trans-marked and voila, very useful

yes its buggy and dirty and there is no sense that its splitted over three files
